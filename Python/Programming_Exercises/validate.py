# --- Directions
# Given a node, validate the binary search tree, ensuring that every node's left
# hand child is less than the parent node's value, and that every node's right
# hand child is greater than the parent
# NOTE:  max and min are built-in functions in Python; however, you can use them
# here as arguments/variables eventhough your syntax highlighter might get you
# thinking otherwise.


def validate(node, min=None, max=None):
    pass
