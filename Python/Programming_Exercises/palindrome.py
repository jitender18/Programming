# --- Directions
# Given a string, return True if the string is a palindrome or False if it is
# not.  Palindromes are strings that form the same word if it is reversed. *Do*
# include spaces and punctuation in determining if the string is a palindrome.
# --- Examples:
#   palindrome("abba") # returns True
#   palindrome("abcdefg") # returns False


def palindrome(string):
    pass
