# --- Directions
# 1) Implement the Node class to create a binary search tree.  The __init__()
#    method should take an argument of "data" and should initialize data
#    attributes: "data", "left", and "right".  "left" and "right" should have
#    initial values of None.
# 2) Implement the "insert" method for the Node class.  Insert should accept an
#    argument "data", then create an insert a new node at the appropriate
#    location in the tree.
# 3) Implement the "contains" method for the Node class.  Contains should accept
#    a "data" argument and return the Node in the tree with the same value.
