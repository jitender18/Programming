# --- Directions
# Print out the nth entry in the fibonacci series. The fibonacci series is an
# ordering of numbers where each number is the sum of the preceeding two.
# For example, the sequence, [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34] forms the first
# ten entries of the fibonacci series.
# Example:
#   fib(4) # returns 3
# NOTE: The above sequence starts at 0.  Stephen's tests assert that the
# solutions are working with a series that starts with 1.  I may change these
# later, but for now, assume 1, not zero.


# def fib(n):
#     """
#     Using recursion
#     """
#     if n <= 1:
#         return n
#     return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

# There are issues with these solutions as the instructions have the Fib series
# starting at zero and Stephen's tests assert that it starts at 1
