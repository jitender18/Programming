# --- Directions
# Write a function that accepts an integer, n, and returns a n x n spiral matrix.
# --- Examples
#   matrix(2)
#     [[1, 2],
#     [4, 3]]
#   matrix(3)
#     [[1, 2, 3],
#     [8, 9, 4],
#     [7, 6, 5]]
#  matrix(4)
#     [[1,   2,  3, 4],
#     [12, 13, 14, 5],
#     [11, 16, 15, 6],
#     [10,  9,  8, 7]]

    -1s on the ranges, as the second argument in a range is non-inclusive. There
    are other ways to do this, but they make my head explode:
